This is a recreation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. Players control paddles on the left and right sides of the screen to bounce the ball back and forth, with the goal of scoring 10 points to win. The game ends when either the left or right player reaches 10 points, displaying the winner.
